  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>
    These Terms of Use govern your use of Nihongo News ("the app"), developed by Andreas Jakob.
    By downloading or using the app, you agree to these terms.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Free Trial &amp; Subscription</h2>
  <p>
    Nihongo News offers a free tier that allows you to generate up to 3 articles.
    To continue generating articles after the free tier, a <strong>Nihongo News Pro</strong>
    subscription is required.
  </p>
  <p>Nihongo News Pro is offered as an auto-renewable subscription:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monthly plan</strong> — billed once per month</li>
    <li><strong>Annual plan</strong> — billed once per year</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Exact prices are displayed in the app in your local currency before purchase.
    Prices may vary by region and are subject to change.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Auto-Renewal</h2>
  <p>
    Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless cancelled
    at least 24 hours before the renewal date. Your Apple ID account will be charged
    within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in
    <strong>Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</strong> on your iPhone or iPad.
    Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period — you will
    retain access until then.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Payments</h2>
  <p>
    All payments are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not store or
    have access to your payment information. Purchases are subject to
    <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html">Apple's Terms of Sale</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Refunds</h2>
  <p>
    Refund requests are handled by Apple. To request a refund, visit
    <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>
    Nihongo News is for personal, non-commercial use only. You may not copy, modify,
    distribute, or reverse-engineer any part of the app. Generated article content is
    for your personal language learning use only.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Service Availability</h2>
  <p>
    Article generation requires an internet connection and depends on the availability
    of third-party AI services (Anthropic Claude). We do not guarantee uninterrupted
    service. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the service with reasonable notice.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>
    The app is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We do not warrant that
    the app will be error-free or that any generated content is perfectly accurate.
    Japanese language learning content is AI-generated and should be used as a
    supplementary learning tool.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental,
    or consequential damages arising from your use of the app.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes
    constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms. Significant changes will be noted
    in the app's App Store release notes.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>
    These terms are governed by the laws of Germany, without regard to conflict of law principles.
  </p>
