  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>
    Japanese AI News Learner ("the app") is a personal Japanese language learning app. This privacy policy
    describes what data the app collects, how it is used, and your rights.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>The app stores the following data on the server to provide its service:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A device identifier</strong> — a random ID generated on first launch, used to associate your articles and vocabulary with your account. No name, email, or personal identity is collected.</li>
    <li><strong>Your learning settings</strong> — JLPT level, preferred topics, regions, writing system preference.</li>
    <li><strong>Generated articles</strong> — the articles generated for your account, including vocabulary words and quiz results.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any contact information.</li>
    <li>We do not collect location data.</li>
    <li>We do not use advertising SDKs or analytics services.</li>
    <li>We do not share any data with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app uses the <strong>Anthropic Claude API</strong> to generate article content.
    Article generation requests (your topic preferences, JLPT level, and recent article history)
    are sent to Anthropic's servers. Anthropic's privacy policy is available at
    <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">anthropic.com/privacy</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The backend is hosted on <strong>Google Cloud Run</strong> and uses
    <strong>Google Firestore</strong> for data storage. Your data is stored in Google's
    infrastructure. Google's privacy policy is available at
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subscriptions and payments are managed by <strong>RevenueCat</strong>. RevenueCat
    receives your anonymised device identifier to manage your subscription entitlement.
    RevenueCat's privacy policy is available at
    <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.
    All payment processing is handled by Apple and is subject to Apple's privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Your data (articles, vocabulary, settings) is stored indefinitely so the app can track
    your learning progress. You can delete individual articles within the app.
    To request deletion of all your data, contact us at the email below.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from
    children under 13.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Significant changes will be noted
    in the app's App Store release notes.
  </p>
